      <h1>What is Extinction Curse?</h1>

      <p>
        An evil hungers beneath the earth. This ancient enemy seeks to undo Aroden’s work from millennia ago and bring desolation to the Isle of Kortos. The heroes destined to confront this enemy have humble beginnings, working as members of a novice circus troupe on the Isle of Erran, just off the north coast of the Isle of Kortos.
        These humble heroes are fated for much more than the circus, however, and with skill and luck might save the entire region from the extinction curse!

      <h2>Coming Together</h2>

      <p>
        The Extinction Curse Adventure Path begins near the small town of Abberton on the Isle of Erran. Abberton has little to recommend it to anyone but its insular inhabitants. Its once-thriving farms produce fewer and fewer crops, and its ranchers have smaller herds than in prior generations. The town’s sheriff has disappeared, and some of its most prominent citizens are gone— no doubt seeking greener pastures elsewhere, the townspeople mutter. If the people of Abberton are in need of anything, it’s a spectacle to distract them from their daily woes—a spectacle like a traveling circus. The Circus of Wayward Wonders has arrived and can provide just the exhibition the town needs.

        The newly formed circus is built on the high hopes of its members. Many are former employees of the Celestial Menagerie, a circus in the nearby port city of Escadar. The manager of the Celestial Menagerie, a cruel catfolk named Mistress Dusklight, is abusive to her employees and downright sadistic to the many animals she exhibits.
        Her shows are always wondrous to behold, and she brings in significant funds operating one of Escadar’s most celebrated attractions. But the public face Mistress Dusklight displays to the crowds is a thin veneer over her callous and self-serving nature. Some of Mistress Dusklight’s employees—perhaps including the heroes—decided they’d had enough of her tyranny and slipped away to form their own circus. These refugees from the Celestial Menagerie founded the traveling Circus of Wayward Wonders. After a few seasons to acquire equipment, train, and practice their shows, the Circus of Wayward Wonders is ready for its first big public show, hosted by the town of Abberton.
